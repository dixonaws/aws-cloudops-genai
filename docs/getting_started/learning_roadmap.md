Course content for each module can be found in the [Modules](/docs/modules) area. Each section has associated homework
and a video. The homework is designed to be representative of a task that could come up on the job as a cloud
administrator. So, you should practice the homework to the extent that you are comfortable with the task and can finish
it in a timeline manner (perhaps, as suggested by your instructor).

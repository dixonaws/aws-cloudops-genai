Silver Lining consists of six stages, as shown below. Only one of them is hands-on, learning the material!

## Preparation
What is your current skill level? More importantly, what is your *level of interest*? Careers in IT and 
cloud administration deal with technology that is constantly changing. You should find satisfaction in continuously
learning new things and solving new problems. While we assume no prior experience, you may need to spend additional time with the content if you have 
limited experience with some of the basics like working in the command-line or networking. Don't 
worry! If you are *interested* you can make it. A good starter is [Linux Survival](http://www.linuxsurvival.com).
Can you picture yourself, potentially all day sometimes, working at the terminal like this to solve problems? If so, then read on!

## Learning
Follow our outline, ideally in order, filling your knowledge gaps where needed. Instead of aiming to memorize
facts and tasks, you should gain a comfort level with each module such that you could execute the homework
in a timely fashion while referring to the documentation if you need to. Practice! Don't be afraid to repeat sections 
until you are comfortable doing the homework with limited assistance.

## Professional Ramp-up
In this stage, you'll get your content together:
* Polish your resume
* Update your GitHub
* Update your LinkedIn
* Publish some videos to YouTube
* Author some content on Medium or Substack
* Consider developing a personal web page

## Certification
During the course, you should aim to complete the following certifications:
* [AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)
* [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)
* Stretch Goal: [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

## Graduation
A solid GitHub is as important as your resume. Create an initial portfolio of what you have done in the homework sections using 
GitHub and YouTube. 

## Job Placement
With certifications, a few up-to-date GitHub repos, some hands-on experience with AWS, you are ready to apply for a 
position as a cloud administrator. Some entry-level positions could be:
* Technical Account Manager
* Cloud Administrator
* Systems Administrator
* Automation Engineer
